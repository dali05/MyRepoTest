## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Modern microservices often require consistent behavior across APIsâ€”standardized responses, predictable error handling, and a uniform approach to configuration and observability.  
The **API Response Starter** was built to solve exactly that.

It acts as a **foundational internal starter** that:
- Unifies **API response structures** and **error formats** across all backend services.
- Reduces boilerplate by **auto-configuring common infrastructure layers** (DB, Kafka, Vault, Storage).
- Enforces **organization-wide consistency** in API documentation, logging, and exception management.
- Promotes **security and maintainability** through Vault-managed secrets and automatic property bindings.

This library allows developers to focus on **business logic**, while infrastructure and best practices are applied automatically through Spring Bootâ€™s autoconfiguration mechanism.
